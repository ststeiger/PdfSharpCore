# PdfSharpCore

**PdfSharpCore** is a partial port of [PdfSharp.Xamarin](https://github.com/roceh/PdfSharp.Xamarin/) for .NET Standard
Additionally MigraDoc has been ported as well (from version 1.32).
Images have been implemented with [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp), which has a stable status.

**PdfSharp.Xamarin** is a partial port of [PdfSharp](http://www.pdfsharp.net/) for iOS and Android using Xamarin, it allows for creation and modification of PDF files.



###### Example project 

There was an example project here. <br />
I've removed it from this project, and put it into a separate solution. 
You can find it [here](https://github.com/ststeiger/Stammbaum).<br />
There's a default font-resolver in [FontResolver.cs](https://github.com/ststeiger/PdfSharpCore/blob/master/PdfSharpCore/Utils/FontResolver.cs).<br />
It should work on Windows, Linux, OSX and Azure. <br />
Some limitations apply. <br />
See open issues. 


## Example usage 

```cs
//See the "Example" Project for a MigraDoc example
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new FontResolver();
    
    var document = new PdfDocument();
    var page = document.AddPage();
    var gfx = XGraphics.FromPdfPage(page);
    var font = new XFont("OpenSans", 20, XFontStyle.Bold);
            
    gfx.DrawString("Hello World!", font, XBrushes.Black, new XRect(20, 20, page.Width, page.Height), XStringFormats.Center);

    document.Save("test.pdf");
}

//This implementation is obviously not very good --> Though it should be enough for everyone to implement their own.
public class FontResolver : IFontResolver
{
    public byte[] GetFont(string faceName)
    {
        using(var ms = new MemoryStream())
        {
            using(var fs = File.Open(faceName, FileMode.Open))
            {
                fs.CopyTo(ms);
                ms.Position = 0;
                return ms.ToArray();
                }
            }
        }
        public FontResolverInfo ResolveTypeface(string familyName, bool isBold, bool isItalic)
        {
            if (familyName.Equals("OpenSans", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase))
            {
                if (isBold && isItalic)
                {
                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf");
                }
                else if (isBold)
                {
                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Bold.ttf");
                }
                else if (isItalic)
                {
                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Italic.ttf");
                }
                else
                {
                    return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Regular.ttf");
                }
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
```
